# Onemax
Python implementation of an evolutionary algorithm for the Onemax problem.

The Onemax problem involves evolving a string of bits to all ones,
and could be considered a simple introductory problem for 
evolutionary computing. This implementation is a genetic algorithm.

This repository comprises three files:
  individual.py - a class representing an individual bitstring.
  onemax.py - the implementation of the algorithm.
  one_max_results.plot - a gnuplot script for plotting the fitness curves acheived.
